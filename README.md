The world of Big Data continues to grow and evolve day by
day, and with it the technologies capable of handling huge amounts of
data. The problem is to choose the right technology and exploit it in a
way that optimises processes working with these data. The aim of this
project is to study and utilise the potential of a NoSQL system such as
MongoDB for storing, extracting and analysing large quantities of data
concerning a system of credit card fraud detection.
To do this, we generated plausible data, saved it in MongoDB, distributed
it in the most efficient way for us, run several queries and finally analysed
the performance of the system. The results showed that the MongoDB
database, if used in the right way, is able to efficiently manage large
amounts of data.
Based on the results, it is clear that in the world of Big Data, if the
technologies to manage it are not used and optimised properly, the per-
formance of the system becomes unacceptable. Specifically, in MongoDB,
the modelling of collections and documents proved to be fundamental.
